                Hi, I'm exited to start my developer career and put to the test all the skills that I've been learning and ready to learn more. I love creating apps and challenging process it involves. I love creating with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and the way it glues everything together. I'm exited to learn more languages/frameworks and anything else involved in the industry and what they have to offer. 

                What drives me is building new things and projects that help me become a better programmer and see this skills progressively impact the company in a positive way. I'm looking for a company that offers mentorship and skilled co-workers that I can learn from, learn everyday and help the company grow. I can't wait to break in the industry and start making some great apps together!
